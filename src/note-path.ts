/**
 * Shared validation for note paths, applied by both the CouchDB and local
 * backends before any read, write, delete or move.
 *
 * The note model is markdown-only: `list_notes` only ever surfaces `*.md`
 * files, and binary attachments are not supported. Enforcing that here keeps
 * the tools from reaching anything that isn't a note, which closes two real
 * problems:
 *   - CouchDB mode: a path like `obsydian_livesync_version` or a `ix:`/`ps:`
 *     prefixed id would otherwise become a document id and overwrite LiveSync's
 *     own control documents, stopping sync on every device.
 *   - Local mode: a path like `.obsidian/plugins/x/main.js` would otherwise
 *     write executable plugin code into the vault, and `.obsidian/.../data.json`
 *     would expose LiveSync credentials.
 *
 * Rules: vault-relative, ends in `.md`, no `..`, no leading `/`, no `:` (its
 * only use here is LiveSync's internal id prefixes), no NUL, and no path
 * segment (split on either slash) that starts with `.` (hidden files and the
 * `.obsidian` config dir). Root-level LiveSync control flag files are also
 * rejected even though they are `.md`.
